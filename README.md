The goal was to build a lightweight React application (using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) integrated with Bootstrap for a simple profile webpage. It is reactive and works on mobile as well.

CSS styling was inspired by [startbootstrap-resume](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-resume).

## Usage

There are 3 things you need to do in order to update the webpage for yourself:

* `.env` - This file has static environment variables. Create a new environment file (e.g. `.env.local`) and set those environment variables with the webpage owner's details.
* `public/img/profile.jpg` - Change it to the webpage owner's profile picture.
* `public/favicon.ico` - Change it to the webpage owner's favicon.

After changes above are done, a simple `npm install` followed by `npm start` should get you up and running.
